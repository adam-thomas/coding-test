# coding-test

My attempt at a programming test for interviewees.

## Setup

This project is designed for a Unix system with Python 3 installed. Run the following in your terminal:

* Clone the project and `cd` into the cloned directory.
* Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .`.
* Activate the virtual environment with `source bin/activate`.
* Ensure Postgres is running on your system ([instructions are here](https://www.postgresql.org/) if you need to set it up).
* Create the database and install dependencies with `make install`.
